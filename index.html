            <h2 class="h2-class">Golf</h2>
            <p>My favorite hobby is golf. I started learning a few years ago when I lived in Arizona and have been obsessed ever since! Below is a picture of my favorite golf course, Tucson National.</p>

            <h2 class="h2-class" id="h2-id">Basketball</h2>
            <p>I also love to play Basketball. I have been playing the sport since I could walk! Below is a gif of my favorite player.</p>

            <h2>Hunting</h2>
            <p>I grew up in a small town in Minnesota and have been hunting since the age of 8.</p>

            <h2>Hiking</h2>
            <p>I also love to hike and camp outdoors. Below is a picture of me at my favorite place to camp, Coronado National Forrest, Arizona.</p>
